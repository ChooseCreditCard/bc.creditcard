          Every card has a billing cycle: a repeating window where your transactions are grouped into a statement,
          given a due date and – if you don’t pay in full – start generating interest. This page explains that engine.

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Billing Cycle?</h2>
      <p>
        A billing cycle is the repeating period (for example, 28–31 days) during which your card issuer
        groups purchases, fees and credits into a single statement. At the end of that period, the issuer
        generates your statement balance and sets a due date.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Understanding the cycle matters because <strong>interest, late fees and even credit-score signals</strong>
        are all tied to how you behave between the statement date and the due date.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Statement date:</strong> when the cycle closes and your balance is “frozen” for that period.</li>
        <li><strong>Due date:</strong> last day to pay at least the minimum without being late.</li>
        <li><strong>Grace period:</strong> time between statement date and due date where you can pay in full and avoid interest on purchases.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- BILLING TIMELINE -->
    <section id="timeline" class="section">
      <h2>Typical Billing-Cycle Timeline</h2>

        While details vary by issuer and country, most credit-card products follow a similar pattern:

              <td>Purchases, refunds and some fees post to your account.</td>
              <td>Spending here will appear on the next statement.</td>

              <td>Grace period</td>
              <td>You can pay the full statement balance with no interest on new purchases (if you started in full).</td>
              <td>Paying in full keeps purchases interest-free on many cards.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Due date</td>
              <td>Minimum payment must be received to avoid a late mark.</td>
              <td>Late payments can trigger fees and negative credit reporting.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>After due date</td>
              <td>Unpaid portions start or continue to accrue interest.</td>
              <td>Carrying balances over multiple cycles increases cost.</td>

        Some issuers vary the exact number of days in a cycle. Always check your statement for the precise dates.

    <!-- INTEREST & GRACE PERIODS -->
    <section id="interest" class="section">
      <h2>Interest, Grace Periods & Minimum Payments</h2>
      <p>
        If you pay the <strong>full statement balance</strong> by the due date, many cards will not charge interest
        on standard purchases. This is the effect of the grace period. But once you start carrying a balance,
        future transactions may start accruing interest immediately.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-3 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Minimum payment:</strong> the lowest amount you must pay to stay current, but usually keeps most of the balance revolving.</li>
        <li><strong>Revolving balance:</strong> any unpaid amount carried to the next cycle, which can accrue interest daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of grace:</strong> if you do not pay in full, some products remove the interest-free period on new purchases.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-3">
        Billing cycles also interact with your <strong>credit-utilisation ratio</strong> — the percentage of available
        credit that is in use when the statement closes. High utilisation on the statement date can be a negative
        signal in many credit-scoring models, even if you pay down the balance shortly after.
